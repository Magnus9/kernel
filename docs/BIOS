
This file contains notes about the BIOS IVT calls that
is registered. The AH register contains sub functionality
for each subdomain (INT X). It is recommended to use the pusha
and popa instruction to preserve register values.

BIOS INT 10h (Video interrupts).
---------------------------------------------------------------
AH: 03h - Read cursor position and size.
On entry:
    AH: 03h.
    BH: Display page number.
Returns:
    CH:     Cursor start line.
    CL:     Cursor end line.
    DH:     Row.
    DL:     Column.
Registers destroyed:

    AL:     Subservice (0-3).
    BH:     Display page number.
    BL:     Attribute (Subservices 0 and 1).
    CX:     Length of string.
    DH:     Row position where string is to be written.
    DL:     Column position where string is to be written.
    ES:BP:  Pointer to string to write.
Returns:
    None.
Registers destroyed:

    AH:     0ah.
    AL:     ASCII value of character.
    BH:     Display page number (text mode only).
    CX:     Number of times to write character.
Returns:
    None.

    AH:     0ch.
    AL:     Pixel color.
    CX:     Horizontal position of pixel.
    DX:     Vertical position of pixel.
    BH:     Display page number (Graphics modes with more than 1 page).

    CX (Horizontal) DX (Vertical) AL (Pixel Color) BH (Page Number).
        0-639           0-349       0-15                0-1
Notes:
    If the pixel color (AL) is specified with bit 7 set,
    the color bits of the pixel are XORed with the color bits
    of the current pixel at the specified coordinate.

BIOS INT 13h (Disk services).
---------------------------------------------------------------
AH: 00h - Reset fixed disk/diskette system.
Prelude:
    Resets the fixed disk or diskette controller and drive,
    forcing recalibration of the read/write head.
On entry:
    AH:     00h.
    DL:     Drive number.
Returns:
    AH:     Status of operation.
    CF:     Set if error, cleared otherwise.
Notes:
    If DL is greater than or equal to 80h, the floppy
    diskette controller is reset, and then the fixed
    disk controller is reset. The status returned in AH
    in this case is the status of the fixed disk; to get
    the status of the floppy diskette controller, examine
    memory location 0:441h.

    If an error is reported by the disk BIOS routines,
    use this service to reset the floppy and/or fixed
    disk controllers, and retry the operation.

    It is said that before interacting with a floppy disk
    drive for the first time, the floppy disk controller
    must be reset to a known state using this BIOS call.
    (Fixed disks aswell?).

AH: 01h - Get disk system status.
On entry:
    AH:     01h.
    DL:     Drive number.
Returns:
    AH:     Status of operation.
    CF:     Set if error, otherwise cleared.
Status of operation codes:
    AH             Meaning
    FFh            Sense operation failed             (fixed)
    E0h            Status error                       (fixed)
    CCh            Write fault                        (fixed)
    BBh            Undefined error                    (fixed)
    80h            Drive not ready
    40h            Seek failure
    20h            Controller failure
    11h            ECC corrected data error           (fixed)
    10h            CRC or ECC data error
    0Fh            DMA arbitration level out of range (fixed)
    0Eh            Control data address mark detected (fixed)
    0Dh            Invalid number sectors on format   (fixed)
    0Ch            Media type not found               (floppy)
    0Bh            Bad cylinder found                 (fixed)
    0Ah            Bad sector flag detected           (fixed)
    09h            Attempt to DMA across a 64K boundary
    08h            DMA overrun
    07h            Drive parameter activity failed    (fixed)
    06h            Diskette change line active        (floppy)
    05h            Reset failed                       (fixed)
    04h            Sector not found
    03h            Attempt to write on write-protected disk
    02h            Address mark not found
    01h            Invalid command
    00h            No error
Notes:
    The most recent diskette operation status is found
    at 0:441h. The most recent fixed disk operation status
    is at 0:474h.

AH: 02h - Read sectors into memory.
On entry:
    AH:     02h.
    AL:     Number of sectors to read.
    CH:     Cylinder number (10 bit value; upper 2 bits in CL).
    CL:     Starting sector number.
    DH:     Head number.
    DL:     Drive number.
    ES:BX   Linear address of memory buffer.
Returns:
    AH:     Status of operation.
    AL:     Number of sectors read.
    CF:     Set if error, else cleared.
Notes:
    Values in DL less than 80h specify floppy disks;
    values greater than or equal to 80h specify fixed disks.

    The cylinder number is a ten-bit quantity (0 through 1023).
    Its most significant two bits are in bits 7 and 6 of CL. The
    remaining eight bits are in CH. The starting sector number
    fits in the low-order portion (lower 6 bits) of CL.

    The value returned in AL (number of sectors read) may not
    give the correct number of sectors, even though no error
    has occurred. Use the results of the Carry flag and
    AH (status flag) to determine the status of the operation.

    Sectors are addressed using CHS (cylinder, head, sector).


Kernel low physical memory map.
---------------------------------------------------------------
0x7c00                                      @ Boot sector (1st sector).
0x00    (0000:0000) - 0x3ff     (0000:03ff) @ Interrupt Vector Table.
0x400   (0000:0400) - 0x4ff     (0000:04ff) @ BIOS Data Area.
0x500   (0000:0500) - 0x9fbff   (9000:fbff) @ Real Mode Free Memory.
0x9fc00 (9000:fc00) - 0x9ffff   (9000:ffff) @ Extended BIOS Data Area.
0xa0000 (a000:0000) - 0xbffff   (b000:ffff) @ Video Memory.
0xc0000 (c000:0000) - 0xc7fff   (c000:7fff) @Â Video BIOS.
0xc8000 (c000:8000) - 0xeffff   (e000:ffff) @ Memory Mapped I/O.
0xf0000 (f000:0000) - 0xfffff   (f000:ffff) @ BIOS.

After the bios segment you reach high memory (0x100000) 1MB. This is the
proper place to place your kernel if the size of it increments at a steadily
rate.

Canonicalizing %CS:%EIP.
---------------------------------------------------------------
The BIOS loads the boot sector of the boot disk
at linear address 0x7c00 (0000:7c00). However certain
odd BIOSes actually begin execution at 07c0:0000. To deal with
this arbitrary outcome, the first task of any bootloader is to
canonicalize %CS:%EIP to a known segment:offset pair that the rest
of the code depends on.
